#### 1.1 Create the virtual environment (depends on your installation)
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
# or
python -m venv myenv
# or
python3.10 -m venv myenv
```

#### 1.2 Activate the virtual environment  
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate # On Linux or macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

#### 1.3 Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash

```bash
pip install your_package
```
